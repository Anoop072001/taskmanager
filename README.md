# taskmanager

Task Manager is a simple app which lets you store your Todos in one area, and if you want you can add todo to your Google Calendar as well.
How awesome is that right?

## Getting Started
# How it works?
<ol>
  <li>Firstly when you open the app,you'll see blank screen(this is the homescreen),this is where you'll find your todos</li>
  <li>You will find a floating add button in bottom right corner,Click it , add the title annd description in the dialog box and click add</li>
  <li>You'll find the todo you added in home screen,You can click the list tile and you can either delete it :no_entry: or add it to Google calendar by clicking clock icon</li>
  <li>After clicking clock icon ,a clock widget will come and you have to set it on which date would you like to set the todo reminder on google calendar</li>
  <li>After Now you'll go to chrome and you'll have to allow the app to have access to google calendar</li>
  <li>reminder will be added successfully</li>
</ol>

# DownSide
You have to allow to app to configure in Google Calendar everytime you click Clock icon, and since my app isn't Google verified you have to go to advanced and allow it in "This app isn't verified by Google" webpage. Other than that it's all good
